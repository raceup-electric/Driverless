HOW TO TEST PATH PLANNING (original version):
 open the workspace root:
 
  source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
  colcon build
  source install/setup.bash
  
 launch the program:
 
  ros2 launch launch/path_planning_launch_test.py show_plot_optimization:=True
  
 you can also test with different parameters. You can find the list of the parameters and
 their possible values at:
  https://github.com/Beomar97/path-planning
  
 the default map is small_track.csv. You can find its file , along with the other maps, at:
  /home/raceupdv/Desktop/path-planning/src/path_planning/resource/maps
  
 If there happen to be errors when launching the code, in the terminal type:
  pip list
 and check if the following libraries have the corresponding verison value set as:
  trajectory_planning_helpers == 0.76
  1.18.1 =< numpy =< 1.21.1
  scipy >= 1.3.3
  quadprog == 0.1.7
  matplotlib >= 3.3.1
  

HOW TO TEST PATH PLANNING IN THE DRIVERLESS WORKSPACE (connected to the SLAM module):
 open the Terminator and type:
  cd driverless_ws
  
 build the following libraries:
  colcon build --packages-select eufs_msgs fs_msgs fszhaw_msgs kvaser_reader_driver graph_based_slam path_planning
 
 divide the terminator in 3, in each partition source ros:
  source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
  source install/setup.bash
 
 in the first partition:
  cd src/
  ros2 launch path_planning/launch/path_planning_launch_test.py 
 
 in the second partition:
  ros2 run graph_based_slam incremental_graph_SLAM
  
 in the third partition:
  ros2 bag play bag_/bag_my_real_track
